Notes
===============================================================
The contents of the SOURCES folder are modified versions of the 
tarballs released by the OpenGrADS project. They are modified in
the following ways:

 1. renamed from grads-[...].tar.gz to opengrads-[...].tar.gz
 2. the single folder inside is renamed from grads-[...] to
    to opengrads-[...]

#2 was made so the extracted directory would match the build
directory rpmbuild expects. #1 was made to differentiate the
tarball from the original release.
